## Objectives
As the streaming industry is becoming a very competitive industry. This project will create a model for predicting whether **Streaming Service Platform** costumers **will churn or not based on their customers' behaviors**. The **goal is to identify which customer are likely to churn**. This project expected to identify 90% customer who are likely to churn with **recall metrics** to minimize miss predict actual churn

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from kaggle website. Each record in the training file represents a customer and includes features such as age, gender, tenure, usage frequency, support calls, payment delay, subscription type, contract length, total spend, and last interaction. The churn label indicates whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0)
